# Fishpocalypse — Phase Tracker

_Living document. Update after every implementation session._
_Status values: `TODO` · `IN PROGRESS` · `DONE`_

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation `DONE`

**Goal:** Runnable empty project with correct settings, folder structure, input wiring, placeholder island, and lerp-follow camera.

### Checklist
- [ ] Project settings: renderer = Forward+ (via features array), window size 1280×720
- [ ] Low-res viewport pipeline: `stretch/mode="viewport"`, `scale_mode="integer"`, render at 640×360 scaled to 1280×720 (2×)
- [ ] Input map: `move_left` (A), `move_right` (D), `move_forward` (W), `move_back` (S), `fire` (LMB), `dodge` (Space), `swap_main` (Q), `swap_secondary` (E), `interact` (F), `open_inventory` (I)
- [ ] Folder structure: `autoloads/`, `scenes/`, `scripts/`, `resources/`, `assets/_placeholder/`, `ui/`
- [x] `GameState` autoload skeleton — signals `day_started`, `night_started`, `wave_cleared`, `buff_day_reached`; `day_count` var
- [ ] `AudioManager` autoload skeleton — stub interface for `play_music`, `stop_music`, `play_sfx`, `crossfade_to`
- [ ] `Main.tscn` — root Node3D with Island, CameraRig, WorldEnvironment (default env), DirectionalLight3D
- [ ] `Island.tscn` — StaticBody3D ground (40×0.2×40) + CollisionShape3D + 3 crate props with collision
- [ ] `CameraRig.tscn` + `scripts/camera_rig.gd` — Camera3D at local (0,9,9) looks at rig center; lerp-follows target XZ; `set_target()` for Phase 2
- [ ] `project.godot` sets `config/run/main_scene="res://scenes/main.tscn"`

### Reminders
- Keep `assets/_placeholder/` clearly named; Phase 8 swaps them out
- **Camera angle updated**: isometric 45° diagonal, ~52° elevation, 60° FOV (Hades/Gungeon genre standard). `camera_offset` is `@export` on CameraRig — tweak live in the Inspector. Default `(7,13,7)`. Position is set by script in `_ready`, not the .tscn.
- Viewport is 640×360 (2× to 1280×720). Final PSX resolution lock (320×180 or 480×270) happens Phase 8

### Bugs
_None yet_

### Warnings
- `WorldEnvironment` in `main.tscn` uses a default `Environment` resource (no sky, no custom ambient). The editor may show a warning about missing sky — this is expected and resolved in Phase 1 when day/night stubs are wired.

---

## Phase 1 — Day/Night Core Loop `IN PROGRESS`

**Goal:** `GameState` drives the cycle. DAY and NIGHT states are visually distinguishable (even with stubs). The buff-day trigger fires correctly.

### Checklist
- [ ] `GameState` state machine: `DAY`, `NIGHT`, `TRANSITION` states
- [ ] Day counter increments each full cycle
- [ ] `day_started` signal emitted on DAY entry
- [ ] `night_started` signal emitted on NIGHT entry
- [ ] `wave_cleared` signal triggers transition back to DAY (stub: manual trigger for now)
- [ ] `buff_day_reached` emitted on every 10th night (nights 10, 20, 30…)
- [x] Environment-swap stub: `DayNightSystem.tscn` — `day_cycle.gd` drives `DirectionalLight3D` rotation + `ProceduralSkyMaterial` color; day and night visually distinct
- [x] Timed DAY duration via `day_length_sec` `@export` on `day_cycle.gd`
- [ ] Debug label in scene showing current state + day count
- [ ] Debug keys: F1 = skip to night immediately, F2 = manually clear wave (back to day)

### Reminders
- `day_cycle.gd` (in `DayNightSystem.tscn`) is **separate** from `GameState` — the two are not yet wired. GameState state machine must be built and connected to `day_cycle.is_night` signal to emit `day_started`/`night_started` correctly.
- Art hooks wired here intentionally — even stub colors reinforce the day/night contrast design decision
- Environment swap is a stub; the red sea shader and full palette land in Phase 8
- `day_duration` and `transition_duration` on GameState are `@export` vars but the autoload is a plain script (no scene), so tune them directly in `game_state.gd` — not in the Inspector.

### Bugs
_None yet_

### Warnings
- `GameState` currently only emits `day_started` once on `_ready` — it has no running state machine. `day_cycle.gd` drives visuals independently via its own `is_night` signal.

---

## Phase 2 — Player Foundation `IN PROGRESS` _(CJ)_

**Goal:** Player moves, aims, and has HP/CP/SP stats that follow the regen rules. Camera follows them.

### Checklist
- [x] `DebugPlayer.tscn`: CharacterBody3D + `AnimatedSprite3D` (billboard, nearest filter) with full spritesheet (idle, walk 4-dir, dodge, fish, hurt, item anims)
- [x] WASD movement in world XZ plane
- [x] Dodge action (`DODGE` input) — direction-based, timed, animation wired
- [ ] Mouse or right-stick aim (player character faces aim direction)
- [x] `Health` component (reusable node: current/max value, `take_damage()`, `heal()`, `died` signal)
- [x] HP on Player via Health component; no passive regen
- [ ] CP stat: starts full; depletes on fire (Phase 3); recharges at rate over time
- [ ] SP stat: starts full; depletes on dodge (Phase 3); regenerates over time
- [ ] `CameraRig` as a separate scene tracking Player's XZ position (lerp speed configurable)
- [ ] Player does not fall through Island

### Reminders
- `Health` component will be reused verbatim on enemies in Phase 4
- CP recharge rate and SP regen rate are `@export` — tune in Phase 9
- Camera is currently embedded in `DebugPlayer.tscn` — needs extraction into a proper `CameraRig.tscn`
- Shoot input stub exists in `DebugPlayer.gd` (prints "Shoot!") — wired to `CombatSystem` in Phase 3

### Bugs
_None yet_

### Warnings
_None yet_

---

## Phase 3 — Ranged Combat `IN PROGRESS` _(CJ)_

**Goal:** Player fires fish weapons. CP/recharge/post-shot-delay are enforced. Dodge consumes SP. Weapon hot-swap works between main and secondary slots.

### Checklist
- [x] `RarityTier` Resource class: `name`, `color`, `weight`, `damage_multiplier`, `shot_delay_multiplier`, `lure_multiplier`, `cost_multiplier`, `heal_multiplier` — note: field is `damage_multiplier` not `weapon_multiplier`
- [x] `RarityConfig` Resource class: `tiers[]` array of `RarityTier`
- [x] All 7 `RarityTier` `.tres` files: common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary, mythic, `???` (`rarity_config.tres` populated)
- [x] `ProjectileData` Resource class: `owner_type` (PLAYER/ENEMY), `speed`, `damage`, `lifetime`, `sprite`; extended with `ProjectileType` (BULLET/LASER), `beam_length`, `tick_rate`
- [x] `FishWeaponData` Resource class: `spawn_day`, `base_damage_per_shot`, `base_shot_delay`, `base_projectiles_per_shot`, `base_recharge_cost`, `rarity`, `projectile`, `sprite_frames`, `sfx`
- [x] 8 `FishWeaponData` `.tres` files: bakunawa_beam, bangus_blaster, crab_cannon, mackerel_burst, sardine_shooter, shark_shotgun, squid_spray, tuna_lobber
- [x] `Weapon` class (`0_weaponTemplate.gd`): `setup(data, rarity)`, `activate()`, `apply_data()`, `shoot()` — fires projectile(s), plays SFX, drives fire timer
- [x] `Projectile` class (`projectile_spawner.gd`): moves via `ProjectileData`, handles BULLET (move + on-hit free) and LASER (tick damage), applies damage via `take_damage()` on body
- [x] `WeaponTemplate.tscn`, `ProjectileSpawner.tscn` scenes exist
- [ ] `CombatSystem` script on Player: `fire()` with CP check → spawn projectiles → deduct CP → start timers; `dodge()` with SP check; `swap_weapon()` toggling slots
- [ ] CP bar depletes and recharges visibly (debug label ok for now; HUD in Phase 7)
- [ ] Placeholder test-dummy target in scene (static node with Health component); projectile deals damage + dummy emits `died`

### Reminders
- `Weapon.shoot()` currently calls `data.projectile.scene.instantiate()` — `ProjectileData` needs a `scene: PackedScene` field or this needs to be reworked via `ProjectileSpawner`
- `base_projectiles_per_shot` > 1 means spawning multiple Projectile instances at slightly fanned angles
- Recharge timer and `base_shot_delay` are separate: recharge = time until CP starts recovering; `base_shot_delay` = minimum time between shots regardless of CP

### Warnings

## Phase 4 — Enemy Pool & Spawn System `IN PROGRESS` _(SEN)_

**Goal:** Three fish enemy types spawn at night, navigate to player, attack. Population scales over nights. Overkill drops fire.

### Checklist
- [ ] `EnemyData` Resource class: `hierarchy_tier`, `spawn_weight`, `base_hp`, `base_damage`, `base_speed`, `base_attack_delay`, `projectiles_per_shot`, `can_shoot`, `projectile` (ProjectileData), `sprite_frames`, `sfx`
- [ ] `.tres` files for NormalFish, TankyFish, ShootingFish (placeholder stats)
- [x] `enemy.gd`: CharacterBody3D that chases player via direct `global_position` delta (no navigation yet); `player_reference` export
- [x] `enemy.tscn`, `enemySpawner.tscn` scenes exist
- [x] `enemySpawner.gd`: spawns enemies on night (connected to `day_cycle.is_night`), random perimeter positions, `calculate_spawn_amount()` (random range), timer-driven
- [ ] `Enemy.tscn` with Health component + billboard Sprite3D + NavigationAgent3D + state machine (`IDLE` → `CHASE` → `ATTACK` → `DEAD`)
- [ ] `NormalFish.tscn`, `TankyFish.tscn`, `ShootingFish.tscn` variants
- [ ] ShootingFish fires `Projectile` toward player
- [ ] Enemy deals damage to Player on melee contact
- [ ] `SpawnEnemySystem` with `SpawnContext` (O(B) rebuild, O(1) per-enemy apply), `BuildSpawnContext()`, `GetPopulationTarget()`, `SpawnEnemy()` weighted-random
- [ ] Enemy spawn rate scaling by `current_night` from `GameState.day_count`
- [ ] On enemy death: overkill threshold check, `SpawnItemSystem.scatter_drop()`, overkill particle/explosion
- [ ] Navigation mesh baked on Island; agents path correctly to player
- [ ] `wave_cleared` fires when all enemies in current wave are dead

### Reminders
- Enemy pooling (reusing instances vs free/new) is a Phase 9 optimization; use `queue_free()` for now
- NavigationRegion3D must be re-baked if the Island mesh changes in Phase 8
- Current `enemySpawner.gd` connects to `day_cycle.is_night` signal directly — needs to be driven by GameState once Phase 1 state machine is complete

### Bugs
_None yet_

### Warnings
- Navigation bake may need re-running after any Island geometry change
- `enemySpawner.gd` does not yet use `GameState.day_count` for scaling

---

## Phase 5 — Item & Inventory System `IN PROGRESS` _(CJ)_

**Goal:** Items drop and scatter, player picks them up, inventory slots are populated, healing items restore HP, buffs apply on buff-days.

### Checklist
- [x] `HealingItemData` Resource: `base_heal_amount`, `use_delay`, `weight`, `sprite` — note: `item_class` (I–IV) and `stack_limit` fields not yet present
- [x] `FishingPoleData` Resource: `base_bar_size`, `base_lure_speed`, `base_lure_chance`, `rarity`, `sprite` _(data class done — DIO populated `.tres` files in Phase 6)_
- [ ] `BuffData` Resource: `stackable`, `is_permanent`, `player_effects`, `weapon_effects`, `enemy_effects`, `spawn_effects`, `sprite`
- [ ] Buff effect classes (GDScript inner classes): `PlayerEffects`, `WeaponEffects`, `EnemyEffects`, `SpawnEffects`
- [x] `ItemsDB` Resource: `fish_weapons[]`, `healing_items[]`, `fishing_poles[]` — populated (see Phase 6)
- [x] 4 `HealingItemData` `.tres` files: bandage, herbal_brew, fish_wrap, sea_blessing
- [x] 3 `FishingPoleData` `.tres` files: basic_pole, reinforced_pole, fish_pole
- [ ] 2 `BuffData` `.tres` files (placeholders)
- [x] Item pickup scenes: `WeaponTemplate.tscn`, `HealingItemTemplate.tscn`, `PoleTemplate.tscn` — hold item Resource ref, `setup(data, rarity)` interface
- [x] `ItemSpawner` (`ItemSpawner.gd`): `spawn_weapon()`, `spawn_healing_item()`, `spawn_pole()`, `spawn_circle()`, `spawn_random_item()` — arc-tween scatter drop with bounce, weighted rarity pick
- [x] `InventorySystem` script on Player: `pole_slot`, `main_slot`, `secondary_slot`, `item_slot_1/2`; `pickup(item)` routing; `use_item(slot)`
- [ ] `BuffSystem` script on Player: `apply_buff()`, `active_buffs[]`, stat multiplier methods
- [ ] `buff_day_reached` signal from GameState → spawn `BuffData` pickup near player
- [ ] Playtest: enemy death drops healing item; player walks over it; HP restores correctly

### Reminders
- `use_item` on a FishWeapon should equip it to the active weapon slot
- `SpawnEnemySystem` reads `active_buffs` to rebuild `SpawnContext` — ensure `BuffSystem.active_buffs` is accessible via signal or getter
- `FishingSystem` in Phase 6 has a stub awaiting `InventorySystem.pickup()` — unblocked once this phase ships

### Bugs
_None yet_

### Warnings
_None yet_

---

## Phase 6 — Fishing System `IN PROGRESS` _(DIO)_

**Goal:** During DAY, player can fish. The minigame produces items into inventory. Fish unlocked by day count.

### Checklist
- [x] `ItemsDB` populated with all concrete `.tres` files:
  - [x] 8 `FishWeaponData` instances (varied rarities and `spawn_day` thresholds)
  - [x] 4 `HealingItemData` instances (bandage, herbal_brew, fish_wrap, sea_blessing)
  - [x] 3 `FishingPoleData` instances (basic_pole, reinforced_pole, fish_pole)
- [x] `FishingSystem` script: active only when `GameState.day_started` fires; cancels on `night_started`
- [x] `FishingSpot.gd`: Area3D proximity trigger; `player_entered` / `player_exited` signals; `facing_marker` for player orientation; auto-added to group `fishing_spots`
- [x] `interact` input near fishing spot → `FishingSystem._start_fishing()`
- [x] `FishingMinigame.tscn` (Stardew-style bar-catch UI):
  - [x] `FishingBar` custom Control: fish cursor (red), player zone (green), visual catch zone
  - [x] Fish cursor moves erratically (random velocity, direction changes)
  - [x] Player zone controlled by holding `INTERACT` (rise/fall physics)
  - [x] Zone size + fish speed driven by equipped `FishingPoleData`
  - [x] Progress fills when fish is in zone; drains otherwise; success/fail states
- [x] Fish pool filtered by `spawn_day ≤ GameState.day_count`
- [x] Catch probability influenced by `base_lure_chance * rarity.lure_multiplier`; weighted pick across all pool types
- [x] Player frozen during minigame (`set_physics_process(false)`); unfrozen on catch/fail/cancel
- [x] Minigame cancels if DAY ends mid-fish
- [x] Caught item spawned as a physical world drop via `ItemSpawner` at player position; player walks over it to auto-pickup via `InventorySystem`

### Reminders
- `spawn_day` on `FishWeaponData` is the primary progression gate — tune thresholds in Phase 9
- `base_lure_chance` and `lure_multiplier` from `RarityTier` together control rare-fish probability
- `_get_equipped_pole()` falls back to `items_db.fishing_poles[0]` if player has no `InventorySystem` — remove fallback once Phase 5 ships

### Bugs
_None yet_

### Warnings
_None yet_

## Phase 7 — UI / HUD `TODO` _(TBD — GLS?)_

**Goal:** All player information is visible. Inventory can be opened and managed. Art-framing screens are in place.

### Checklist
- [ ] `HUD.tscn` (CanvasLayer always visible during gameplay):
  - [ ] HP bar (tied to Player.health)
  - [ ] CP bar (tied to CombatSystem.cp)
  - [ ] SP bar (tied to CombatSystem.sp)
  - [ ] Equipped weapon icon + name (main + secondary)
  - [ ] Item slot icons (item_slot_1, item_slot_2)
  - [ ] Day counter + phase label (DAY / NIGHT)
  - [ ] Night wave progress (enemies remaining / total)
- [ ] `InventoryUI.tscn` (opens/closes with `open_inventory` input):
  - [ ] Grid view of store arrays
  - [ ] Click to equip FishWeapon to main or secondary slot
  - [ ] Click to use HealingItem immediately
- [ ] Screen effects:
  - [ ] Hurt flash (red vignette on take_damage)
  - [ ] Low-HP persistent red vignette (below 25% HP)
  - [ ] Bloody camera gradual tint (below 10% HP)
- [ ] `IntroScreen.tscn`: shown on game start; artist-statement text + "Press to continue"
- [ ] `GameOverScreen.tscn`: shows nights survived; short fisherfolk-labor recap text; "Play Again" button
- [ ] All UI elements legible at the low-res SubViewport resolution

### Reminders
- Intro/game-over text is the arts course deliverable — write intentional copy here, not placeholder filler
- Low-res viewport may require integer-scaled UI or a separate CanvasLayer not affected by SubViewport

### Bugs
_None yet_

### Warnings
- UI scaling strategy needs validation: Control nodes in CanvasLayer may need `anchor` and `size` tuned for the integer-scaled window

---

## Phase 8 — Art & Audio Integration `TODO` _(TBD — GLS?)_

**Goal:** The game looks and sounds like Fishpocalypse. The arts course concepts are fully legible.

### Checklist

#### PSX Render Pipeline
- [ ] SubViewport resolution finalized and locked
- [ ] All sprite imports: `texture_filter = Nearest`, no mipmaps
- [ ] Optional: PSX vertex-jitter shader on environment mesh
- [ ] Optional: dithering post-process shader on SubViewport

#### Day Palette (Module 2 — warm/cutesy)
- [ ] `WorldEnvironment` day preset: warm ambient, soft directional light, mild fog
- [ ] Lo-fi ambient morning audio loops in AudioManager
- [ ] Island and props use warm/earthy color palette textures

#### Night Palette (Module 2 — gritty/horror)
- [ ] `WorldEnvironment` night preset: dark, high-contrast, cool/red-tinted ambient
- [ ] Red sea shader (ShaderMaterial on water plane: animated red tint + foam)
- [ ] Screen grain shader (CanvasLayer, NIGHT only)
- [ ] Heavy retro horror audio loop in AudioManager
- [ ] Day→night crossfade wired in GameState TRANSITION state

#### Philippine Mythology Enemy Skins (Module 1 & 2)
- [ ] Research + select names for Normal, Tanky, Shooting fish types → document in `PLAN.md`
- [ ] Normal Fish → `_________`: sprite sheet created/sourced, assigned to `NormalFish.tscn`
- [ ] Tanky Fish → `_________`: sprite sheet, assigned
- [ ] Shooting Fish → `_________`: sprite sheet, assigned
- [ ] Names visible in enemy death/intro (at minimum in HUD or kill-feed label)

#### Fisherfolk Narrative Framing (Module 1)
- [ ] Intro screen copy: 2–4 sentences; frames the experience as fisherfolk labor/precarity
- [ ] Game-over copy: ties nights survived to a statement about persistence/precarity; not generic "you died"
- [ ] DAY period feel: ambient fish sounds, dock ambience; reinforce labor

#### Combat VFX
- [ ] Overkill explosion: particle burst (GPUParticles3D) + brief screen shake on enemy overkill
- [ ] Projectile hit: small impact particle
- [ ] Blood decal: a `Decal` node stamped on ground at enemy death position (one texture, no system needed)

#### SFX / Audio
- [ ] Player footstep (day surface)
- [ ] Player hurt sound
- [ ] Player dodge whoosh
- [ ] Enemy hit sound
- [ ] Enemy death sound
- [ ] Weapon fire SFX (per weapon type or generic; routed through AudioManager)
- [ ] Fishing minigame SFX (cast, reel, catch, fail)
- [ ] Day/night music crossfade confirmed working in AudioManager

#### Asset Replacement
- [ ] Replace all `assets/_placeholder/` sprites with final art
- [ ] Replace placeholder Island geometry with final 3D island mesh + textures
- [ ] Re-bake NavigationRegion3D after final Island mesh

### Reminders
- Document Philippine mythology enemy names here and in `PLAN.md` — this is an explicit arts grade criterion
- The day→night transition is the **central artistic image**. Play it. It must be visceral and clear.

### Bugs
_None yet_

### Warnings
- Re-bake navigation after any mesh change or enemies will path incorrectly

---

## Phase 9 — Balance, Optimization & Ship `TODO`

**Goal:** The game is fun, stable at 100+ enemies, and ships as a playable Windows executable.

### Checklist

#### Balance
- [ ] Tune `RarityTier` stat multipliers (`damage_multiplier`, `shot_delay_multiplier`, etc. — are rare weapons meaningfully stronger?)
- [ ] Tune `SpawnEnemySystem` scaling factor (does difficulty ramp feel fair/escalating?)
- [ ] Tune weapon economy: CP costs vs recharge rate — can player sustain fire without trivially camping?
- [ ] Tune buff-day rewards — are buffs impactful enough to feel earned?
- [ ] Tune fishing drop rates — are good weapons too easy/hard to fish up? (`base_lure_chance` + `lure_multiplier` per tier)
- [ ] Tune `spawn_day` gates on `FishWeaponData` — does progression feel earned?

#### Performance
- [ ] Enemy pooling: pre-instantiate N enemies at level load; recycle on death instead of `queue_free()`
- [ ] Confirm stable fps with 100+ enemies active (Godot profiler: check physics, navigation, rendering)
- [ ] NavigationAgent3D update tick rate (can lower for offscreen enemies)
- [ ] Billboard/Sprite3D LOD (hide or simplify far enemies)
- [ ] Occlusion culling enabled in project settings

#### Final Pass
- [ ] Bug pass: play through 20+ nights looking for crashes, stuck enemies, inventory edge cases
- [ ] Export templates installed for Windows Desktop
- [ ] Export via: `godot4 --headless --path . --export-release "Windows Desktop" builds/fishpocalypse.exe`
- [ ] Exported `.exe` launches, intro screen shows, full loop works
- [ ] Playtest with someone unfamiliar — do the art concepts land without explanation?

### Reminders
- The arts grade depends on the playtest question above: are Module 1 + Module 2 legible to an outside viewer?

### Bugs
_None yet_

### Warnings
_None yet_

---

## Known Cross-Phase Reminders

- **After every implementation session:** Update the relevant phase status, tick checklist items, and log any bugs or warnings discovered. Update `PLAN.md` if any architectural or scope decision changes.
- **Navigation re-bake:** Required any time `Island.tscn` geometry changes (Phase 0, Phase 8).
- **Placeholder marking:** All stand-in assets live in `assets/_placeholder/` — check before Phase 8 that nothing is still pointing there unintentionally.
- **Arts course deadline:** The Module 1 + 2 art integration must be grader-legible. Don't defer the intro/outro copy and mythology naming — schedule them intentionally in Phase 8.
- **Phase 5 / Phase 6 integration complete:** `FishingSystem` routes caught items through `ItemSpawner` as physical world drops; `InventorySystem` auto-picks them up when the player walks over them. Both systems are unblocked.
